Hey there, quick blog post today. A colleague recently asked a question and I thought the answer would make for a good and short how-to video. Have you checked out [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/) yet? If not, go check it out and get started for free today. If you have checked it out, and are using it, you might come to a point where you need to change your public/private key pair for a variety of reasons. At first glance, it can be pretty overwhelming to figure out where you need to go to make this change, but to help you out, I have created a short 5 minute video. [Check it out over on Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Azure-Container-Service/Azure-Container-Service-How-to-change-your-public-key) and let me know your thoughts! If you have any other questions, as always, comment below – I’d love to help.
