**Watch the Channel 9 Video of the Demo at **[**https://aka.ms/azurexplat**](https://aka.ms/azurexplat)

Do you have an Azure subscription or are you interested in getting started with Azure but you don’t use Windows as a primary OS? Come learn how to manage your Azure subscription from both Ubuntu and OS X using PowerShell Core based on .NET framework. In this session we will break down the process of creating a resource group, all dependencies, and deployment right from the command line from any platform – Linux, OS X, and Windows. We will even cover how to manage your source control using GitHub and create and edit JSON templates you can then use for your deployments. Lastly, I will show you how you can accomplish all of the above from Visual Studio Code, another tool available from any platform.
