I’m Jessica! Welcome to my blog! I’ve always joked that I get paid to talk. But now everyone can also read my thoughts, opinions and occasional complaints for free right here! But I will also require feedback — do you agree with me? Why? Do you disagree? Why?

A lot of my posts will probably revolve around the Windows 7 topic, yes… (can you tell by the name? — I’m slightly obsessed) but will also highlight other elements (applications, platforms, etc.) as well.

What would you like to read about? I want to know!

On Windows 7 now? Having problems? Ask me for a solution!

That’s all for this introduction today,

Jessica
