**Note: This post is now old. Please use [my latest installer from this blog post](https:/jessicadeen.com/linux/powershell-core-master/). **

Quick update today – I previously wrote new install scripts for PowerShell Core Versions 6.11 and 6.14 with the AzureRM.NetCore.Preview module and optional install of Azure CLI (1.0).

**Today, I have updated them!** The below scripts have been modified to install the current, as of today (8/2/2017), version of PowerShell Core (Beta 6.04), an optional install of updated AzureRM.NetCore, and Azure CLI 2.0. You can access the scripts using the below links. As always, please read the script prior to running it on your system – you should NEVER run a script without reading it first, no matter who authored it.

[Linux Ubuntu 14.04](https://github.com/jldeen/SVCC-AzureMgmtxplat/blob/master/install/14.04/betaps6.04_14.04_install.sh)  
[Linux Ubuntu 16.04](https://github.com/jldeen/SVCC-AzureMgmtxplat/blob/master/install/16.04/betaps6.04_16.04_install.sh)
