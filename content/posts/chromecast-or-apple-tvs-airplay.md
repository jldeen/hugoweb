I have been slacking, severely, on creating new blog posts on a daily basis. So, with that, be prepared for a slew of posts in the next few days.

Please note: this is my personal review on the Google Chromecast. I ordered one the other day for a few reasons – first, I’m a nerd so I like new things; second, I am an avid Apple TV user but would like something more portable for friend’s houses and travel; and third, because I was able to use my Amazon points so the dongle ended up costing me a mere $1.77.

It just arrived a few hours ago and… honestly, I’m not impressed. Don’t get me wrong, I understand the purpose of the Chromecast and all but I just don’t think it’s there yet. I have been using AirPlay via Apple TV for several years now and, while some problems occur here and there, it generally works. The Chromecast, however, is just cumbersome and clunky. I have an Asus RT-N56U router running the latest ASUS firmware. This router, per Google’s own guide, supports Chromecast natively, without any modifications. I had to perform a factory reset within the first 15 minutes of using the Chromecast because I thought I configured it incorrectly. I hadn’t, it just doesn’t work very well… yet. 

I go through the setup of the Chromecast alright but after it joins my network, none of my devices can see the Chromecast in the Google Cast app. I have several Apple devices and Windows devices. It’s quite frustrating. I left the Google Cast app open and I noticed my Chromecast becomes available and disappears at very inconsistent times. This still happens. I can use it but I have to wait 45 seconds or so until any of my devices see the Chromecast and then quickly lose the connection all together. 

I was hoping to configure the Chromecast for others, or at least see how complicated the configuration is, in hopes of sending it to family members and friends as a present so that they may use my Plex media server whenever they wish. Unfortunately, I will have to look at the Roku lite or other options as a cheap medium for my Plex server since the Chromecast, at this stage in its development, is just simply unreliable.

I am defintely interested in what others have to say, even if that means you disagree with everything I have written. Feel free to comment below.
