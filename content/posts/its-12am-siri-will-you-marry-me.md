I’ll admit it…I have the latest Apple product with the smart ass assitant “Siri.” For those who did not see my orignal post regarding my thoughts on siri, you can find that [here](https:/jessicadeen.com/tech/apple/siri-says/ "Siri says…").

So I’m just going to make this short and sweet considering I have already written my facetious opinions down on the public bathroom walls of blogging for the world to read.

I love it. I do. I love sir. I love everything about this 64GB bundle of joy. What I love most, however, is that I know longer have to get the dreaded messages from iTunes showting at me that I have exceeded capacity once again. AND, that my phone doesn’t look up all the time or drop calls from AT&T — yeah, switched to Verizon too.

Anyway, on the note of switching to Verizon, I noticed a very peculiar thing when I transitioned.

Contacts.

Merging contacts after porting over from AT&T to Verizon seems to be a troublesome issue for both carriers. And, because mine are backed up “in the cloud” or via multiple Exchange servers, I don’t really ever opt for the “Let me transfer your contacts for you and inadvertently screw your address book up” offer. Despite how genuine it may be.

Anyway, I pulled my 13″ MacBook pro out in the Verizon store, backed up my previous 32GB iPhone 4 (Black and White) and ensured all relevant data would be preserved. I then connected the new 64GB iPhone 4s (Solid White) to my computer and restored said backup. I have done this countless times on AT&T — especially when I was beta testing iOS 5 and jailbreaking my device every 15 minutes. This went normally as planned…until….

I looked at my messages and many of my contacts were showing up by their phone numbers and not their names! Their entries were still present in my address book but the numbers and names were having a fight or quarrel over who stole who’s significant other. Or something. There is always some epic love battle going on with technology as the opponents in my head. Sigh.

Anyway, then I came accross the following forum discussion via Apple — it worked. So the ultimate point of this extraordinarily unnecessary blog entry was to post this for those who come across the same issue when moving to Verizon:

> 1) Open the Phone and dial *228. This is a Verizon over-the-air programming number.

> 2) When the system answer press 1 for “Program or activate your phone”
> 
> 3) Wait for the call to disconnect. You should get a prompt stating something like, “Settings updated.”
> 
> 4) Open the Task Manager and kill the Phone, Message, and Contacts Applications
> 
> 5) Wait a few minutes (I waited 3 just to be extra safe)
> 
> 6) Open the Message App to verify the fix.

> If you are still broken, kill the Message App again, then reboot your phone.”
