Are you curious about deploying Windows apps to Kubernetes? Would you like to use Draft and Helm just as you would if you were deploying Linux apps/containers? This is the blog post for you! 

Maybe you attended KubeCon North America and participated in the tutorial led by Patrick Lang on myself where we walked through the process and discussed some key details to be aware of. If you did attend or didn't attend, don't worry! We have you covered. We have scrupulously documented all the resources we used and have them available at the following links:

[Patrick's resources: (Lab, tutorial, etc)](https://github.com/PatrickLang/KubernetesForWindowsTutorial)

[Jessica's resources: (Demo repos modified for DevOps CI/CD tooling)](https://gist.github.com/jldeen/e18cb7453bf8814565f5a5ffdc740065)

This blog post will also be updated just as soon as the video of our tutorial is live!

*** Edit ***

The video is now live!
