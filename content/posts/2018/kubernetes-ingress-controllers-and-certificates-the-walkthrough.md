I have gone through a written walk through of [Ingresses and Helm Charts](https://jessicadeen.com/aks-and-helm-charts-ingress-controllers/) before back in May, but this is the updated version __**with**__ a video; I'm SO excited. The content I walkthrough today is something that's been asked about for a very long time and I could not be more stoked to finally offer it up to the interwebs. Links to the files shown in the below video can be found here:

[Ingress Configuration Markdown file](https://github.com/jldeen/croc-hunter/blob/master/cert-ingress-config.md)
[cluster-issuer-staging.yaml](https://github.com/jldeen/croc-hunter/blob/master/cluster-issuer-staging.yaml)
[cluster-issuer.yaml (prod)](https://github.com/jldeen/croc-hunter/blob/master/cluster-issuer.yaml)
