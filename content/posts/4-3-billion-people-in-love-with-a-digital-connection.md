I’m about to have a n3rd-gasm. Deal with it. Or sod off! Haha!

It’s official. As of February 3, 2011 we have successfully exhausted the internet. I’m slightly in shock though I guess it’s to be expected. Back when IPv4 protocol was first created / developed in 1981 I highly doubt anyone expected it to be the massive black hole of socialization it is now.

I mean, really, does a 6 year old truly need an iPhone, Android or Blackberry device to check a FB he or she isn’t even supposed to have? Okay. That’s probably a slight exaggeration. I’m sure little Johnny is calling Elmo or Big Bird for some helpful advice about where to start with lunch first. Sandwich or cookie? Tough decisions when you’re in first grade…

For those who don’t know, IPv4 protocol is the standard as it stands right now but beginning this summer that’s all about to change. Facebook, Yahoo and Google are on board with the IPv6 testing as of June 8th. IPv6 differs from the current standard through it’s 128 bit address which means a total of 2<sup>128</sup> or 340 undecillion. That’s a big word for my nerdy brain which is currently purring in sheer pleasure. That’s virtually impossible to max out. This should be interesting…I’m curious if there will be any hic-ups or what will happen until this “new” protocol is as wide-spread as it’s predecessor. IPv4 works off of out dated technology. It only uses 32-bit or 4 byte addresses. You know — 75.25.153.105 or something to that effect. That alone limits the available address spaces to 2<sup>32</sup> or 4.3 billion. That’s a lot of people. But that’s even more devices…think about it. In my tiny 1 bedroom “Jes-sized” apartment alone I have on average 5-6 devices requiring an IP address at any given time. And a majority of them are in some way connected to the social-networking world. I have two Apple TVs both connected to YouTube and Netflix, a desktop with Windows XP that therefore has access to Twitter, FaceBook, and Lord knows what else, a MacBook Pro that has the same connection as the desktop and my iPhone which has everything. Literally. I am connected, entwined and all wrapped up in this social love affair with instantaneous pseudo intimacy which only perpetuates numerical and emotional exhaustion.

Perhaps this literal IPv4 32 bit exhaustion is a sign….maybe, just maybe, we as a population have begun to place far too much emphasis on our “need” to feed this addiction to the online world. I mean, I know I myself have a compulsion to check my AP Mobile app daily, read my standard TechCruch realtime jargon, peruse the latest with Apple via MacHash, allow Engaget to serenade my brain with it’s luscious announcements and digest the typical FB news/drama. I need to have the updates. Or at least I *think* I do…

I tell myself I *need* to know what is going on out there in the world. How did we ever acquire such information before the age of the internet? How did we manage to carry on throughout our days without knowing that Kimmy ate a slice of pepperoni and anchovy pizza at the mall today while her terrier sat in her 5 series BMW luxury sedan barking incessantly at passing pedestrians outside? What would we do if we didn’t know the minute Steve Jobs has taken medical leave…for the 3rd time? How could we live without pondering how Tim Cook’s sexuality will now affect his role at Apple as he steps in to be the interm CEO? What I think I wonder about most is how acceptable this addiction has become. Over 4 billion people seemingly crave to be connected in some way shape or form and somehow through this digital age we have convinced ourselves that the appropriate medium is through zeros and ones.

01110000 01110011 01100101 01110101 01100100 01101111 00100000 01101001 01101110 01110100 01101001 01101101 01100001 01100011 01111001 00100000

This concept of digital connection appears to fuel me more often than actual nutrients do. What is wrong with this picture?
