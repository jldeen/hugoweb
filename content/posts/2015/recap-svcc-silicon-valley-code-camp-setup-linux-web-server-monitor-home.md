For those of you who couldn’t make it out to my session at this year’s Silicon Valley Code Camp, I have uploaded my deck and notes to this post. Alternatively, if you did make it out my session and wanted a hard (digital) copy of my presentation and my notes, this post is also for you! I know it was hard to see the commands on the projector, but hopefully the notes will assist in your own setup at home.
