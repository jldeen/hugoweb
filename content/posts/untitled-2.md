Last week I spoke at Jenkins World in SF and had a blast. What a conference! If you were there and attended my sessions, thank you so much for coming out. If you weren't able to make it, no worries, I'm going to write about the meat and potatoes todya.

In both of my sessions I focused on a Jenkinsfile CI pipeline with and Azure DevOps CD pipeline for my demos. The neat thing is since I used a Jenkinsfile, which meant my CI was in a PaC(pipeline-as-code) format, I could recycle and repeat the same steps across multiple projects. This blog post will document _how_ I accomplished using the same Jenkinsfile for 2 different projects - and I only changed 2 lines of code!
