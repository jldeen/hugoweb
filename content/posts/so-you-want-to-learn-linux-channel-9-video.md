![](https://cdn.jessicadeen.com/content/images/learnlinux_960_xyvnaw.jpg)Over the years one of the most popular questions I’ve received from fellow systems administrators / IT Pros / ops colleagues is, “How did you learn Linux?” For many sysadmins / network admins, their wheelhouse consists of Windows based administration and this video is intended to help you get started with Linux administration. Check out this video to go hands on with a mixed environment media server / web monitor project where mostly all of the administration is done through CLI on Linux.
