As you probably know, Bash is coming to Windows 10. If you are in the Insider Preview program, you can play with it today! Build 14316 was released to Insider users in the Fast Ring, which was announced in [this Windows Blog post](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/04/06/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14316/) a few hours ago. As the post points out, you will need to do a few things first to run native Bash on Ubuntu on Windows:

1. Turn Developer Mode on by going to Settings > Update & Security > For developers.
2. Search for Turn Windows Features on or off and enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)
3. Open Command Prompt, type “bash” without the quotations and follow the on screen instructions.

I’m gonna play around with this today and let you know my thoughts in a later blog post. Let me know yours as well in the comments below!
