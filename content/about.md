She previously worked for Microsoft in a variety of capacitities for over a decade. She began as a vendor in April of 2009, became a full time employee in March of 2016, and left in 2022 to join AWS. Prior to joining Microsoft, she spent over a decade as an IT Consultant / Systems Administrator for various corporate and enterprise environments, catering to end users and IT professionals in the San Francisco Bay Area. Jessica holds three Microsoft Certifications (MCP, MSTS, Azure Infrastructure), 3 [expired] CompTIA certifications (A+, Network+, and Security+), 4 Apple Certifications, and is a former 4-year Microsoft Most Valuable Professional for Windows and Devices for IT.

When she’s not doing something geeky, you can find her doing something active with her family, most likely camping or hiking. She also enjoys biking, shooting, eating, reading, and hanging with her 9-year-old rescue pup Miley and her 2-year-old Covid puppy, Drake. Yes, both dogs are named after celebrities.
